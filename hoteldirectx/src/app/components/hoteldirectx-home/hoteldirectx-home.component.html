        <h2>Helping you to work transparently with your partners giving you full control of your distribution & supply
          chain</h2>
        <p>TravelgateX has been in the connectivity business for almost a decade now. Nowadays markets are more volatile
          than ever and technology have become very sophisticated. At Travelgate, we have always looked for ways to
          exceed
          our partners’ changing needs. One of those needs is to increase their portfolio of directly contracted
          partners
          in the most straightforward and timely manner. DirectX makes this possible! How, you ask? Well, we are taking
          advantage of our direct connectivity to many players, and making connecting hotel chains a breeze! </p>

                    <p>So, who does what?</p>
                    <ul>
                      <li><span>Has TravelgateX become a consolidator?</span><br>Absolutely not. We are creating a new way to serve our clients, just like we once built the largest hub of suppliers in the world, we are now building a hub of direct connect to hotels.</li>
                      <li><span>Is TravelgateX acting as principal?</span><br>Absolutely not, TravelgateX continues acting purely as a tech partner. Hotels are fully responsible for the delivery of service at all times.</li>
                      <li><span>What is then the role of the OTA?</span><br>The OTA is the key partner of the hotel distributing their product.</li>
                      <li><span>Is TravelgateX acting as a channel manager?</span><br>Not exactly. We are handling hotels rates and availability through our +50 connections with channel managers where hotels have their repository of product</li>
                      <li><span>Do I still have to sign an agreement with hotels?</span><br>There is no need to sign agreements with every single hotel or chain. The contractual relationship between the OTA and the hotel is born simultaneously and tacitly with the formalization of the reservation through the Direct-X service.</li>
                      <li><span>Do I still have to sign an agreement with channel managers?</span><br>There is no need to sign agreements with channel managers. TravelgateX will take care of the connectivity with hotels wherever hotels keep their inventory updated on.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>What’s is it for me?</p>
                    <ul>
                      <li><span>What’s is my commission?</span><br>The OTA will receive public dynamic rates additionally to the commission negotiated with the hotel. This could vary from hotel to hotel at every moment.</li>
                      <li><span>How can I activate DirectX?</span><br>Easy, request your free activation as usual by filling in the form on the following link. Remember, this connectivity is free of charge!</li>
                      <li><span>Is there any minimum business required?</span><br>No, you can start buying from one booking. No restrictions at all.</li>
                      <li><span>Costs</span><br>Is there any connectivity cost? There are no hidden costs  in activating, DirectX. For all effects and purposes, DirectX would work just like another Premium Partner. No setup, no maintenance, no usage cost. It is the Hotels who are covering it in order to get direct access to you!</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Product</p>
                    <ul>
                      <li><span>What if I already buying the same hotel through a 3rd party supplier?</span><br>Not a problem at all. DirectX will constitute an additional source of product at a potential different price and availability.</li>
                      <li><span>What hotels are going to be available on DirectX?</span><br>We keep constantly expanding the portfolio of hotels available through DirectX You can see the list of hotels we have included at any time via this link.</li>
                      <li><span>Is there any cache between systems?</span><br>There is no cache system between the OTA and the hotels. TravelgateX can implement a cache solution if necessary in order to improve the response time.</li>
                      <li><span>What about the mapping?</span><br>You can either use our own mapping files or DirectX can provide you the full mapped product.</li>
                      <li><span>Do I have to take care of any systems setup?</span><br>Not at all, it will just be one additional Premium connection via TravelgateX.</li>
                      <li><span>What if, at some point, I want to sign a direct agreement with a hotel chain?</span><br>No problem!. In that case, hotels would be also available through a traditional TravelgateX connection instead of via DirectX.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Payments</p>
                    <ul>
                      <li><span>Is it a prepaid or postpaid type of product?</span><br>This is all about prepaid product meaning bookings should always be paid before the arrival of the final customer. This way of working should ensure the best rates and availability from hotels.</li>
                      <li><span>How much should I pay?</span><br>The OTA will collect the commissionable rate from its customers. Once OTA’s commission is deducted, they will proceed to pay the net rate to the hotel.</li>
                      <li><span>When should I pay?</span><br>Full payment is due at time of the booking in case of non-refundable rates. For refundable bookings, the OTA will be responsible for settling payment before the booking enters the cancellation period.</li>
                      <li><span>What happen with cancelled bookings?</span><br>Bookings must be cancelled online via TravelgateX.</li>
                      <li><span>Should I pay TravelgateX or should I pay the hotels directly?</span><br>The OTA will only have to pay the net price to the hotel. No payment is required to TravelgateX.</li>
                      <li><span>What are the payment types available?</span><br>Prepayment is the key to get the most competitive rates and availability from the hotels. TravelgateX has two alternatives at your disposal: Virtual Credit Card and Instant Transfers. In both cases:
                        <br>- OTA will have to sign an agreement with the financial entity and open an account.
                        <br>- OTA will have to allocate in advance the necessary amount of money.
                        <br>- TravelgateX will double check at the time of the booking and before confirming it the necessary funds are available in the OTA’s account. Otherwise bookings cannot be confirmed.
                        <br>- TravelgateX will work with the most relevant financial companies providing both solutions.

                    <ul>
                      <li><span>Will I get commissionable or net rates?</span><br>Travelgate will make sure the OTA receives both the net and the commissionable rate for the same hotel room.</li>
                      <li><span>Can I add a markup on top of the rates delivered by hotels?</span><br>Rates are binding.</li>
                      <li><span>What content (texts and pictures) I will be receiving?</span><br>The OTA will receive whatever is available in the channel manager, CRS or PMS that TravelageX is pulling the information from.</li>
                      <li><span>How will I receive remarks from hotels?</span><br>Special remarks from hotels are provided by hotels in a text format and will arrive to the OTA through their API with TravelgateX.</li>

                      <li><span>Any other invoice?</span><br>No, that’s it. Hotels are covering TravelgateX tech fees.</li>
