                            work just like another Premium Partner. No setup, no

                            covering it in order to get direct access to you!

                            commissionable rate from its customers. Once sales
                            channels commission is deducted, they will proceed
                            to pay the net rate to the hotel.

                            payment before the booking enters the cancellation

                            - Sales channels will have to allocate in advance
                            the necessary amount of money. <br />
                            - Travelgate-X will double check at the time of the
                            booking and before confirming it, that the necessary
                            funds are available in the sales channels account.
                            Otherwise bookings cannot be confirmed.<br />
                            - Travelgate-X will work with the most relevant

                            ><br />There is no need to sign agreements with every single sales channel. The contractual relationship between the selling party and the hotel is born simultaneously and tacitly with the formalization of the reservation through the HotelDirect-X service.

                            ><br />Easy, you as the tech partner is already an exciting partner with TGX so no extra setup is needed, just the creation of HotelDirect-X as a new sales channel with you.

                            For refundable bookings, the sales channel is responsible for settling payment before the booking enters the cancellation period via VCC or a Virtual Wallet.

                            competitive rates and availability from the hotels.
                            Travelgate-X has two alternatives at your disposal:
                            Virtual Credit Card and Instant Transfers. In both
                            cases:<br />
                            - The sales channel will have to sign an agreement with the financial entity and open an account. <br />
                            - The sales channel will have to allocate in advance the necessary amount of money. <br />
                            - Travelgate-X will double check at the time of the booking and before confirming it, that the necessary funds are available in the sales channel account. Otherwise bookings cannot be confirmed.<br />
                            - Travelgate-X will work with the most relevant
                            financial companies providing both solutions.
